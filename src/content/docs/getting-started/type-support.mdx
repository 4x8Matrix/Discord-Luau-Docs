This guide will walk you though setting up working LSP type support for the Discord-Luau package.

:::tip
This guide assumes the following;

- You've set up your environment, if you've not already done this, please take a look at [this guide](/getting-started/environment/)
- You've already installed the Discord-Luau package, if you haven't already done this, please take a look at [this guide](/getting-started/installation/)
:::

### Context

The Luau language has support for Alias declarations, however, Luau-LSP requires you to do some additional setup to enable these alias declarations
to function.

Since the Discord-Luau package uses Luau language aliases, you'll need to set up some additional configuration to get functional type support.

### Git Submodules

<Steps>

1. Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project root, IF there's not one already available.
    Lune should of already created this file as we need to do some [additional setup for the Lune runtime anyway](/getting-started/environment/#lune)

2. If not already preasent, please add the following to the `.vscode/settings.json` file;
    ```json
        "luau-lsp.require.directoryAliases": {

        }
    ```
3. Add the following to the `luau-lsp.require.directoryAliases` object;
    ```json
        "@Builders": "DiscordLuau/Package/Classes/Builders",
        "@Network": "DiscordLuau/Package/Classes/Network",
        "@Objects": "DiscordLuau/Package/Classes/Objects",
        "@Data": "DiscordLuau/Package/Data",
        "@Enums": "DiscordLuau/Package/Enums",
        "@Std": "DiscordLuau/Package/Std",
        "@Utils": "DiscordLuau/Package/Utils",
        "@Vendor": "DiscordLuau/Package/Vendor",
    ```
4. Restart Luau-LSP, check to see if the library can now resolve the require aliases.

</Steps>
