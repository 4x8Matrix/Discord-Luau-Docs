Well, i'll deffo get around to this at some point...

At the moment, this is partial implementation of the API, some classes are yet to get documented, and some already have some'ish docs..

But, that said - I will be updating this eventually, and assigning this it's own discord-luau domain :)

(I did throw in two examples tho, they're pretty cool!)
